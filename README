# WhereAmI
A quick command line tool to get your geographic coordinates using the OS X [CoreLocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreLocation) framework.

## Usage
Open with Finder to execute, or in the terminal. If it can determine a location, it will output longitude, latitude, accuracy in meters and the time the location was found. WhereAmI tries to get a recent location, and will not display one if it is more than a minute old (to avoid inaccurate results from CoreLocation's cached data). If it cannot get location data, it will quit and print an error message.

## Notes
This is a quick and dirty example. I make no guarantees or warranties as to its accuracy, stability or compatibility (it should work with 10.7 and 10.8, but I have only tested it on 10.7). Feel free to do with it as you wish.
